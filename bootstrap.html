                <h4>URL where website hosted:</h4><a href="https://rory-corcoran.github.io/imd-website/"></a>


                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Navbar</h4>
                    <p>I used icons along with the navigation links. <br> I tried to use Scrollspy but couldn't get it
                        to work so
                        I added ID's to each section so when user clicks on Nav link, they are brought to appropriate
                        section. I
                        made the Nav fixed and left the href for the Navbar Brand empty so it brings the user back to
                        the top. <br>
                    </p>

                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Splash Screen</h4>
                    <p>I added a CV download button with attached CV. <br> I also added a Modal with a form to email me
                        which has
                        a close button and a send button. And I added an alert to show the user that their message has
                        been sent
                        successfully. Initially this was working fine but then I started having to click it twice to
                        close the alert. I couldn't figure out why.</p>

                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p>I used cards for this section as I was having trouble sizing my image and found the cards to
                        help.
                        <br>Added icons. Linkedin & Github open in new tabs. Twitter & Facebook icons are empty. I added
                        a JQuery
                        script to prevent all links with # as the href from doing anything as the page would adjust
                        sometimes when
                        clicking on these links.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p>I used the Acordian for each college I have attended. I also added a logo for each college, which
                        opens a
                        link to the course page off site in a new tab. Initially I split this section into 2 columns and
                        tried to
                        put the logos for each college in a list-group-item in the first column, but when the accordians
                        were open
                        the logo's stayed fixed and I didn't like it. So I decided to get rid of the columns and put the
                        logo in the
                        Accordian button <br> In the Accordian content, I used Navs and Tabs to display the different
                        years. I also
                        used tables in both TUD & Colaiste Dhulaigh Accordians. <br>I have the first accordian open on
                        default. <br>
                        The reason I left a large amount of white space under the last accordian is because without it
                        the Work
                        Experince would show when all Accodians are closed and I thought it looked cluttered. I don't
                        like having a
                        chunk of white space there but I thought it was the lesser of 2 evils. </p>

                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Work Experience</h4>
                    <p>I didn't use any components here just used two columns, one for Irish Experience, one for
                        Overseas.</p>

                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Projects</h4>
                    <p>I used Cards with Icons to display the projects I have worked on.<br> Each Card has a Popover on
                        the "More" Button, which opens to reveal information about each project. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Interests</h4>
                    <p>I used a series of icons to illustrate my interests.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Contact Me</h4>
                    <p>I used icons beside each of the ways I can be contacted.
                        <br>I also used the MapBox map centred on TUD - Tallaght as dynamic content.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Footer</h4>
                    <p>I used an arrow button which brings the user back to the top of the page.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>Templates etc</h4>
                    <p>I didn't use any templates. I started from scratch. I used code snippets from W3Schools and
                        Bootstrap 5
                        documentation as well as using Youtube tutorials for guidance </p>
